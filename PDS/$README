This ZIP holds everything you should need to correctly Assemble and Link ASMGASM
with the March 1976 updates applied, ASMG27A.

All target libraries are named CBT507.ASMG27A.???.  Scan all JOB Streams for
'CBT507' and you will find all references to the target libraries.

I have applied various local fixes/changes/updates every here and there.  Scan f
my last name, 'Skomsky' to find these.

I used the UPDATE facility within Assembler G to apply all SOURCE updates except
for module ASMGF1.  Updates for ASMGF1 were applied manually.  DO NOT TRUST ThE
SEQUENCE NUMBERS WITHIN ASMGF1.  I had to create the sequence numbers manually
to apply these updates.  I took the easy way out for this task.  I cheated by
backing into the sequence numbers from the top of thes source deck and from the
ass end of the source deck.  The sequence numbers then converge somewhere in the
middle of the member.  It ain't pretty, but it works.

All ASMG27A updates for MACROS were manually applied.  There were only four (4)
macros updated anyway.

During the update process of Assembler G, I moved ALL MACROS within the SOURCE
and placed them into the MACLIB where they should have been all along.
Duplicate MACROS were removed.

While testing various GENERATION options, I encountered Assembly time errors
with some MACROS and source members.  I applied local fixes to overcome these
errors.  Again, scan for my last name and you will see how I did this.

I have tested this code the best way I know how.  It should work exactly as The
University of Waterloo designed it to.  But I cannot guarantee anything.

After you have configured all Job Streams for your computer, run the Job streams
in the following sequence to get everthing working:

1) MACLIB.ASMG27A.JCLA to load the MACLIB PDS.
2) LKEDCTL.ASMG27A.JCLA to load the Linkage Editor control PDS.
3) SOURCE.ASMG27A.JCLA to load the SOURCE PDS.  This is a large file and contain
   43,000 statements.
4) ASMGBASE.ASMG27A.JCLA to Assemble all modules and load the OBJLIB PDS.
5) ASMGLINK.ASMG27A.JCLA to create the LOADLIB PDS with Assembler G (ASMGASM).

The system configuration I currently use consists of:

1) Dell Latitude D610 PM 2.0Ghz with 2048Mb and 80GB HDD.
2) MS Windows XP Pro w/SP2.
3) MS Virtual PC 2007.
4) MS W98SE running in a "guest" Virtual Machine.
5) Hercules 3.05 running within the W98SE "guest" machine and configured as a 30
6) IBM MVS 3.8J running within the Hercules/3090 virtual/virtual machine.
7) CTC SPF/PRO 5.0 running within the W98SE guest machine to do all editing.


This is PTF#1 for Assembler G, level ASMG27A.  It corrects an MNOTE issued when
ASMGF7X is Assembled using IFOX00.

This ZIP holds a replacement for Job Stream MACLIB.ASMG27A.JCLA, but only
one MACRO has been modified.  MACRO OPCD contained an error with a SETC using a
specified length and that length is greater than the length of the string
being manipulate IFOX00 doesn't like that condition while ASSEMBLER G and
ASSEMBLER H just truncates the string to the shorter length and continue.

Use MACLIB.ASMG27A.JCLA contained within instead of the one contained within
ASMG27A.ZIP.

Scan MACRO OPCD for my last name "Skomsky" to find my fix.
